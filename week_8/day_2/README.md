# Advanced SQL and Java - Day 2

## Sequence

A sequence is a database object that generates a sequence of unique numeric values. It is often used to create unique identifiers for rows in a table, such as primary keys.

It generates a sequence of numbers according to a specified pattern. The sequence can be configured to start at a specific value, increment by a certain amount, and have a maximum or minimum value.

Popular databases, such as Oracle, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server, support sequences as a built-in feature. Note that each database may have its own syntax and options for creating and managing sequences.

### Real World Example

Real-world applications of sequences include:

- Creating primary keys for database tables.
- Priority based ticketing systems.
- Sequence of students waiting to be served in a cafeteria.

### Implementation

The syntax to create a sequence may vary depending on the database system you are using. Below is an example of how to create a sequence in PostgreSQL:

```sql
CREATE SEQUENCE sequence_name
  [INCREMENT BY increment_value]
  [START WITH start_value]
  [MINVALUE min_value]
  [MAXVALUE max_value]
  [CYCLE | NOCYCLE]; -- Whether the sequence should restart when reaching max or min value
```

- `sequence_name`: The name of the sequence.
- `INCREMENT BY`: The value by which the sequence will increment (default is 1).
- `START WITH`: The starting value of the sequence (default is 1).
- `MINVALUE`: The minimum value of the sequence (default is 1).
- `MAXVALUE`: The maximum value of the sequence (default is no maximum).
- `CYCLE | NOCYCLE`: Specifies whether the sequence should restart when reaching the maximum or minimum value.

Example of creating a sequence:

```sql
CREATE SEQUENCE student_id_seq
  START WITH 10
  INCREMENT BY 10
```

This sequence starts at 10 and increments by 10 each time a new value is generated. The first few values generated by this sequence would be 10, 20, 30, and so on.

Another example:

```sql
CREATE SEQUENCE order_id_seq
  START WITH 1000
  INCREMENT BY -1
  MINVALUE 900
  MAXVALUE 1000
  CYCLE
```

This sequence starts at 1000 and decrements by 1, cycling back to 1000 when it reaches 900.
