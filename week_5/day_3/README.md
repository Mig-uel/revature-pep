## Cross Join

A `CROSS JOIN`, commonly known as a `CARTESIAN JOIN`, is a type of join in SQL that returns the Cartesian product of two tables. This means that it combines each row from the first table with every row from the second table, resulting in a set of all possible combinations of rows.

If no condition is provided, the result set is generated by multiplying each row from the first table with each row from the second table. This can lead to a large number of rows in the result set, especially if both tables have many rows.

**Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT *
FROM table1
CROSS JOIN table2;
```

### Real World Application

`CROSS JOIN` is used when we need to find all possibilities of combining multiple records, where the result set includes every row from each contributing table. This is particularly useful in scenarios such as:

- Generating all possible combinations of products and customers for a marketing campaign.
- Creating a schedule that pairs every employee with every available project.
- Analyzing the impact of different marketing strategies by combining them with various customer segments.

`CROSS JOIN` can also be used to identify missing relationships or gaps in data by generating all possible combinations and then filtering out the existing relationships.

### Implementation

Let's consider a real world example involving an online store. Below, we have two tables `Customers` and `Products`:

**Customers**

| customerId | f_name  | l_name    |
| ---------- | ------- | --------- |
| 1          | Alice   | May       |
| 2          | Bob     | Parker    |
| 3          | Charlie | Chocolate |

**Products**

| productId | productName | price  |
| --------- | ----------- | ------ |
| 101       | Laptop      | 999.99 |
| 102       | Smartphone  | 499.99 |
| 103       | Headphones  | 79.99  |

Let's generate all possible combinations of customers and products using a `CROSS JOIN`.

```sql
-- Cross join to generate all combinations of customers and products
SELECT Customers.CustomerId, Customers.f_name, Customers.l_name,
       Products.productId, Products.productName, Products.price as ProductPrice
FROM Customers
CROSS JOIN Products;
```

In this example, the `Customers` table represents the store's customers, and the `Products` table represents the available products with their prices. The `CROSS JOIN` generates all possible combinations of customers and products, allowing you to see every customer paired with every product.

**OUTPUT**

| customerId | f_name  | l_name    | productId | productName | ProductPrice |
| ---------- | ------- | --------- | --------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| 1          | Alice   | May       | 101       | Laptop      | 999.99       |
| 1          | Alice   | May       | 102       | Smartphone  | 499.99       |
| 1          | Alice   | May       | 103       | Headphones  | 79.99        |
| 2          | Bob     | Parker    | 101       | Laptop      | 999.99       |
| 2          | Bob     | Parker    | 102       | Smartphone  | 499.99       |
| 2          | Bob     | Parker    | 103       | Headphones  | 79.99        |
| 3          | Charlie | Chocolate | 101       | Laptop      | 999.99       |
| 3          | Charlie | Chocolate | 102       | Smartphone  | 499.99       |
| 3          | Charlie | Chocolate | 103       | Headphones  | 79.99        |

This information can be useful because now we can analyze potential sales opportunities, understand customer preferences, and generate comprehensive reports for marketing strategies.
