# JavaScript and Typescript: Week 11, Day 3

## JSON

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate. It is commonly used for transmitting data in web applications.

A JSON object is a collection of key-value pairs, where keys are strings and values can be strings, numbers, arrays, booleans, or other JSON objects.

- A key is a string enclosed in double quotes.
- A value can be a string, number, array, boolean, or another JSON object.
- A key-value pair is separated by a colon (`:`).

```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 30,
  "isStudent": false,
  "courses": ["Math", "Science", "History"],
  "address": {
    "street": "123 Main St",
    "city": "Anytown",
    "zip": "12345"
  }
}
```
