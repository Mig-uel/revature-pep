# Week 11 - JavaScript and Typescript - Day 4

## What is TypeScript?

#### What is JavaScript?

JavaScript (JS or ECMAScript) started as a simple scripting language for web browsers. At the time it was invented, it was expected tp be used for short snippets of code embedded in HTML pages -- writing more than a few dozen lines of JavaScript was considered bad practice. Due to this, early web browsers executed JavaScript code slowly, and the language itself was not designed for large-scale software development. Over time, JavaScript became more and more popular, and web developers started using it to create interactive experiences. Web browser developers responded to this increase in popularity by expanding the capabilities of JavaScript, which in turn led to even more widespread adoption. On modern websites, your browser is frequently running applications written almost entirely in JavaScript.

JS has become popular enough to be used outside the context of browsers, such as implementing JavaScript runtimes like Node.js, which allow developers to write server-side applications in JavaScript. The "run anywhere" nature of JavaScript has also led to its use in a variety of other contexts, such as desktop applications (using frameworks like Electron), mobile applications (using frameworks like React Native), and even embedded systems.

#### What is TypeScript and How Does It Relate to JavaScript?

TypeScript (TS) is a programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript, which means that any valid JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript code. TypeScript does not consider any JavaScript code to be invalid, but it adds additional features to the language that are not present in JavaScript.

Since TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, it adds rules about how different kinds of values can be used together.

TypeScript preserves the runtime behavior of JavaScript, meaning that TypeScript code is transpiled (or compiled) into JavaScript code before it is executed. For example, dividing by zero in JavaScript results in `Infinity` instead of throwing an error, and this behavior is preserved in TypeScript.
