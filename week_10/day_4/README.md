## Overview of CSS

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is used to style and layout web pages â€” for example, to alter the font, color, size and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features.

A CSS file consists of a set of rules that define how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule consists of a selector and a declaration block:

```css
selector {
  property: value;
  property: value;
}
```

Declarations are key/value pairs that specify the styling to be applied to the selected elements. For example:

```css
h1 {
  color: blue;
  font-size: 12px;
}
```
