# Spring, HTML/CSS, JavaScript Intro - Day 3

## Overview of HTML

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.

- HyperText refers to the links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites.
- Markup Language refers to the way tags are used to define the page layout and elements within the page.

#### Purpose of HTML

HTML provides the fundamental structure for web pages. It defines how content should display and organize using various elements represented by tags. HTML is the backbone of the web, forming the basis for web browsers to render content.

#### What HTML Does

- **Creates Structure**: HTML tags define a web page's structure including elements like headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images, and more.
- **Semantics**: HTML tags not only structure content but also provide meaning to the content, helping search engines and assistive technologies understand the content better.
- **Links**: HTML allows the creation of hyperlinks, enabling navigation between different web pages and resources.
- **Multimedia**: HTML supports embedding images, audio, and video content directly into web pages.

#### Key HTML Elements

- **Paragraphs**: `<p>` defines a paragraph.
- **Line Breaks**: `<br>` inserts a line break.
- **Headings**: `<h1>` to `<h6>` define headings, with `<h1>` being the highest level.
- **Links**: `<a>` defines a hyperlink.
- **Images**: `<img>` embeds an image.
- **Blocks**: `<div>` defines a division or section in an HTML document.

#### Applications of HTML

- **Web Development**: HTML is used to create and design web pages and web applications.
- **Navigation**: HTML enables the creation of navigation menus and links between different sections of a website.
- **Embedding Media**: HTML allows for the integration of multimedia elements like images, videos, and audio into web pages.
- **Client-Side Storage**: HTML5 introduced features for client-side storage, allowing web applications to store data locally on the user's device.
- **Game Development**: HTML5 provides capabilities for creating browser-based games using the `<canvas>` element and WebGL.
- **Data Entry Support**: HTML forms allow users to input data, which can be processed by web applications.
- **Interacting with Native APIs**: HTML5 includes features that enable web applications to interact with device hardware and native APIs, such as geolocation and camera access.
